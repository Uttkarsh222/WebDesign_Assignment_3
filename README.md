The assignment involves creating a dynamic web page with specific functionalities. Key features include:

Initial Display: Show full name and NUID upon page load. The table should be collapsed initially.  

Button Behavior: The 'Submit' button is initially disabled and not clickable. An 'Add New Student' button should dynamically add new students with placeholder values like 'Student 4', 'Teacher 4', etc.

CSS Application: Newly added rows should inherit existing CSS styles.

Feedback Messages: Display success or error messages upon record addition or deletion, mentioning the specific student's name.

Checkbox Interactions: Selecting a checkbox changes the row's background color to yellow, enables the 'Submit' button, and adds 'Delete' and 'Edit' buttons for row-specific actions. Deselecting reverts these changes.

Row Expansion: Clicking green arrows toggles the expansion and collapse of rows.
